== Disabling CT: Advertisement Widget on 404 pages ==
In this theme, you have the choice to disable/enable ads in your 404 Page. A 404 page is what a user sees when they try to reach a non-existent page on your site. It can either be because they clicked a broken link, the page has been deleted or they’ve mistyped a URL. When your site displays a third party advertising network(s)/site(s) in, this is considered framing content. Placing Google ads on such pages is strictly prohibited and if done, it is adjudged as a violation. However, most affiliate links and sponsored posts from trustworthy source, as long as your site’s primary purpose is to create original content, and not merely to send traffic to these sites. So it is recommended to disable your ad widget if you don’t have an extensive knowledge of the guidelines and consequences for 404 pages.
